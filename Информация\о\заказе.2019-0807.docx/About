This malware downloads files from some site.
Starting with the While statement, function "q" is called, function "jQX" is called in "q", and function "R" is called in "jQX".

The function "R" calls multiple functions, completes the ActiveXObject setting, creates a temporary file, enters the binary code of the file responded from the site, and stores it in local storage.
When processing is done, delete the temporary file and all its paths from function "R" to delete the record.

This malware may be a piece of a large malware, or it may be a piece that works on its own.
